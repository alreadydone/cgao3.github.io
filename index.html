<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Welcome! I am a PhD student at the Department of Computing Science, co-supervised by Martin Mueller and Ryan Hayward. I received my M.S. degree in 2015 from the <a href="http://cs.ustc.edu.cn">Department of Computer Science and Technology</a> from University of Science and Technology of China, where I worked at <a href="http://ubri.ustc.edu.cn/">USTC-Birming Joint Research Institute in Intelligent Computation and Its Applications</a>.</p>
<h3>Research Interest</h3>
<p>My research interests include computer games, reinforcement learning, combinatorial optimization. My current research topic is applying neural networks to the game of Hex. </p>

IEEE Transaction on Games, 2017. This paper investigates the move prediction problem in Hex. By learning on MoHex 2.0 self-play generated data, MoHex-CNN achieves 70% winrate against MoHex 2.0 on 13x13 board size after using the learned knowledge as its in-tree prior probability. </p>
