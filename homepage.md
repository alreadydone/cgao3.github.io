### Biography
 Welcome! I am a PhD student at the Department of Computing Science, co-supervised by Martin Mueller and Ryan Hayward. I received my M.S. degree in 2015 from the Department of Computer Science and Technology from University of Science and Technology of China, where I worked at UBRI.

### Research Interest 
 My research interests include computer games, reinforcement learning, combinatorial optimization. My current research topic is applying neural networks to the game of Hex.

### Publication

- Chao Gao, Ryan Hayward, Martin Mueller. Move Prediction using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in Hex. IEEE Transaction on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games. Method described in this paper learns from MoHex 2.0 self-play data to improve MoHex 2.0, similar to one iteration of AlphaGo Zero. The resulting MoHex-CNN achieves 70% win-rate against MoHex 2.0 on 13x13 board size.

European Journal of Operational Research, 260.1 (2016): 1-11. link. A family of pseudo-cuts are proposed with a novel concept of pseudo-gap. The derived iterative algorithm becomes the-state-of-art approach for solving MMKPs.

- Chao Gao, Xin Yao, Thomas Weise, Jinlong Li. An efficient local search heuristic with row-weighting for the set covering problem. European Journal of Operational Research, 246.3 (2015): 750-761. link. A simple stochastic local search algorithm is proposed which has similar or even better performance with the best existing algorithm (3-flip search based Lagrangian reduced cost) for solving SCPs.
